All mandatory specialist agents available and confirmed during startup: whycode:frontend-web-agent (Next.js, React, html2canvas), whycode:frontend-native-agent (Expo, React Native, Skia), whycode:backend-agent (core types, plugin system, GraphQL adapter, Postgres/Prisma), whycode:backend-auth-agent (Clerk multi-tenant), whycode:deploy-vercel-agent (Vercel serverless). Convex not applicable (Postgres + Prisma used instead). No GitHub integration detected; Vercel CLI status unknown in pre-code phase but Vercel deployment is reference platform. Monorepo (Turborepo) coordinates 7 packages: core, react-native, web, linear, cloud-client, cloud (Next.js), examples. Key architecture: separate frontend SDKs for web and native (distinct platforms, Skia vs html2canvas); single backend for core + GraphQL + Linear; specialist auth for Clerk; specialist deploy for Vercel. Routing rules: frontend-web -> whycode:frontend-web-agent; frontend-native -> whycode:frontend-native-agent; backend/plugin system -> whycode:backend-agent; Clerk auth -> whycode:backend-auth-agent; Vercel deploy -> whycode:deploy-vercel-agent. Selected: completion mode strict (no partial deliverables), max 30 iterations, turbo-teams speed (parallel specialist agents), Linear team Suisios (SUI) for issue tracking. Ready to spawn specialist team."
