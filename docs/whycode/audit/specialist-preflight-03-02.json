All pages require 'use client' since they use Convex hooks (useQuery, useMutation) and Clerk hooks (useOrganization). Framework is Next.js 15 App Router. Convex is cloud-live mode - no local dev commands. shadcn/ui components needed: dialog, select, badge, label, table, tooltip. Existing components: button, card, input."
