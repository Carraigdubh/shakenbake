  "notes": "Web SDK package (@shakenbake/web) is a standalone React/DOM library, not a Next.js app. Framework mode is 'react-web' since this package provides client-side trigger plugins, screenshot capture via html2canvas-pro, and browser context collection. Rendering baseline is 'client-heavy' as all web SDK functionality is inherently client-side (DOM event listeners, Canvas APIs, navigator APIs). No server components involved at this layer. Dependencies to add: react/react-dom as peerDependencies, html2canvas-pro as dependency, @types/react and @types/react-dom as devDependencies, jsdom for vitest testing environment. tsconfig.json needs jsx and DOM lib settings."
