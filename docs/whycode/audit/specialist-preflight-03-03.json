  "notes": "Plan 03-03: Reports Pages for ShakeNbake Cloud. apps/cloud is a Next.js 15 App Router project with Clerk auth, Convex database, and shadcn/ui components. All dashboard pages use 'use client' directive (client-heavy rendering baseline within App Router framework). Tasks: (1) Reports list page with app/severity filters and usePaginatedQuery pagination, (2) Report detail page with screenshot viewer, audio player, context JSON display, (3) Dashboard overview with report count summary cards. Existing patterns confirmed from apps/page.tsx and [appId]/page.tsx: useOrganization + getOrganization for org context, useQuery with 'skip' for conditional queries, Next.js 15 Promise params with React.use(). All shadcn/ui components needed (Button, Card, Table, Badge, Select) already installed. Convex reports API (listReports, getReport, getReportCounts) and apps.listApps available."
