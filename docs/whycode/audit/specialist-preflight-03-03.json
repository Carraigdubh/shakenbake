  "notes": "Plan 03-03: Web SDK Report Form & Provider. @shakenbake/web is a React client-side SDK (not Next.js App Router). Framework mode is react-web because this is a standalone SDK package, not a Next.js app. Rendering baseline is client-heavy (all components use client-side React with inline styles). Task 019: ReportForm component with portal, form validation, theme support, loading/success/error states. Task 020: ShakeNbakeProvider with state machine (idle -> triggered -> capturing -> annotating -> form -> submitting -> success/error -> idle), React context, and useShakeNbake hook. Task 021: ProxyAdapter (DestinationAdapter for server-side proxy pattern), integration tests, and full export wiring. All dependencies already installed (react, react-dom as peerDeps/devDeps, @shakenbake/core). vitest with jsdom environment configured. 96 existing tests passing."
