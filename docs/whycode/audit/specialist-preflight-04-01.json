  "notes": "React Native SDK package (@shakenbake/react-native) is a standalone library, NOT an Expo app. It will be published as a library that consumers install into their Expo apps. All native modules (react-native-shake, react-native-view-shot, expo-device, expo-network, expo-battery, expo-localization, expo-constants, expo-screen-orientation, @react-native-community/netinfo) are peerDependencies. The package itself only needs to compile TypeScript. appType resolved as 'expo-managed' because PRD specifies Expo SDK 54+ with development builds. Router resolved as 'expo-router' per PRD architecture. Module resolution: NodeNext (from tsconfig.base.json). All RN/Expo imports use dynamic import with try/catch to ensure compilation succeeds without peer deps installed. Tests use vitest with mocked native modules (environment: node)."
