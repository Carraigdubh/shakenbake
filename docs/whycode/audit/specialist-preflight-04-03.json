  "notes": "Plan 04-03: React Native SDK Report Form and Provider. All prerequisites confirmed: @shakenbake/core types (BugReport, ReportInput, SubmitResult, ShakeNbakeConfig, PluginRegistry, ReportBuilder) are available. Plans 04-01 and 04-02 are complete with ShakeTrigger, ViewShotCapture, DeviceContextCollector, DrawingCanvas, and useDrawingOperations all implemented and tested (44 passing tests). This plan adds ReportForm UI component (Task 028), ShakeNbakeProvider + useShakeNbake hook (Task 029), and integration wiring with tests (Task 030). All components use dynamic imports for react-native peer deps following the established pattern from DrawingCanvas. Package is a library, not an Expo app."
