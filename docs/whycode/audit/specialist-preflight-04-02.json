  "notes": "Plan 04-02 implements Skia annotation overlay for @shakenbake/react-native. This is a library package (not an Expo app) so no app.json exists. @shopify/react-native-skia is added as a peerDependency. All Skia imports use dynamic import or graceful fallback patterns since the peer dep may not be installed. Resolved context: expo-managed (per PRD and CLAUDE.md specifying Expo SDK 54+), expo-router (per docs/whycode/capability-plan.json routing plan). Package compiles with TypeScript only; Skia native modules are tested via mocks in vitest (node environment). Pre-existing: 15 tests passing, tsconfig with jsx: react-jsx, vitest.config.ts with node environment."
