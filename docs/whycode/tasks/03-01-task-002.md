- `apps/cloud/src/components/header.tsx` - Client component with OrganizationSwitcher, UserButton, mobile hamburger
- `apps/cloud/src/components/dashboard-shell.tsx` - Client component managing sidebar open/close state
- `apps/cloud/src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` - Server layout with `dynamic = "force-dynamic"`, wraps DashboardShell
- `apps/cloud/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Welcome page with quick-start guide

### Summary
Built a responsive dashboard layout with a fixed sidebar (hidden on mobile, visible on desktop), a header with Clerk OrganizationSwitcher and UserButton, and a mobile hamburger toggle. The layout uses `force-dynamic` to avoid static prerendering which would fail without Clerk environment variables.
