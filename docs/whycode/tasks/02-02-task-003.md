## Summary

Added three public query functions to `apps/cloud/convex/reports.ts`:

1. **listReports**: Paginated query with orgId (required), appId (optional), severity (optional) filters. Uses by_orgId or by_appId indexes with desc ordering.
2. **getReport**: Single report by ID with resolved storage URLs (screenshotUrl, screenshotOriginalUrl, audioUrl) via ctx.storage.getUrl().
3. **getReportCounts**: Severity breakdown counts (total, low, medium, high, critical) for an organization.
