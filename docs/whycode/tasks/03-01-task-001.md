### Files Created
- `apps/cloud/src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`
- `apps/cloud/src/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx`

### Summary
Created Clerk catch-all auth routes for sign-in and sign-up. Both pages use Clerk's hosted UI components (`SignIn`, `SignUp`) centered on the page with a muted background. `fallbackRedirectUrl` set to `/dashboard` so users land in the dashboard after authentication.
